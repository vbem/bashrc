# remote-bashrc
A simple bashrc script for remote source

### Usage:
A *remote bashrc source* may load your personal bashrc from remote without modifying any file on that server.
```sh
source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vbem/remote-bashrc/master/bashrc.sh)
```
- Bind *remote bashrc source* to a SSH terminal hotkey may save your time when you have to switch among many servers back and forth.
